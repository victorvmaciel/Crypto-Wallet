## Getting started ##

Crypto-Wallet is a simple way to calculate your cryptocoin savings! 
It is a Rails 2.7.2 application so the first thing to do to get started is to install its dependencies:

    $ bundle install

For persistence the app uses postgreSQL. So libpq-dev lib is expected to be installed on server machine. This can be done easily in Ubuntu like this:

    $ sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
    
* System dependencies

* Database: Postgres SQL

* Database initialization
